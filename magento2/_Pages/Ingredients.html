		<h3>Vitamin A (as retinyl palmitate) </h3>
	<p>Anyone out there like to read a good book, play video games, go for a run or multitask like a pro? Enter: Vitamin A - your vision, bone growth and brain health support - to the rescue, in nearly everything you live to do. </p>
	<br><br>

	<li><h3>Vitamin C ( as ascorbic acid) </h3>
	<p>Sure vitamin C is found in lots of fruits, like oranges, but too much sugar is bad for the body (especially your waistline!). Get your daily dose of immune boost and mood enhancer all in one shot (belly fat NOT included). </p>
	<br><br>

	<li><h3>Vitamin D2 ( as Ergocalciferol)</h3>
	<p>When we think Vitamin D, we think suntans, shorelines and bikinis, right? Well, since we have yet to bottle that little ray of sunshine, 24 Hour Health is the closest source to this super vitamin that has been shown to positively effect blood pressure, cholesterol, joints, muscles and skin!  No SPF suntan lotion required.</p> 
	<br><br>

	<li><h3>Vitamin E (As d-alpha tocopheryl acetate)</h3>
	<p>I wish there was a magical vitamin to protect my cells from damage that comes with the wear and tear of life and aging...WISH GRANTED! Vitamin E is packed with antioxidants to do just that and has even been shown to help with some diseases of the nervous system, cataracts, asthma, skin disorders, and sunburns.</p>
	<br><br>

	<li><h3>Thiamin-Vitamin B1(as Thiamine hcl USP)</h3>
	<p>Natural energy! This gem of a vitamin is used to boost the immune system, for promoting a positive mental attitude, and even for diabetic pains, heart disease, aging, and so many other things. You’ve got a good one with Vitamin B1.</p>
	<br><br>

	<li><h3>Riboflavin-Vitamin B2 (as Riboflavin-5-phosphate)</h3>
	<p>Riboflavin is another amazing B vitamin that plays a major role in energy production for the cell and in growth development. Yet another boost of natural energy that your body needs. You're welcome. Oh, and it is used to treat riboflavin deficiencies such as acne, muscle cramps, carpal tunnel syndrome, and some blood disorders. Legit. </p>
	<br><br>

	<li><h3>Niacin - Vitamin B3 (as Inositol hexanicotinate USP)</h3>
	<p>We all have heard about good cholesterol (HDL) and bad cholesterol (LDL). There is strong evidence to support that Niacin has the super power to impact cholesterol levels by boosting good cholesterol (HDL) and lowering bad cholesterol (LDL). Perhaps even more important is that Niacin may help reduce the hardening of the arteries for some people – rigid, fatty arteries can lead to heart attack and other debilitating heart disease. Niacin to the rescue!
	</p>
	<br><br>
	<li><h3>Biotin (as biotin USP)</h3>
	<p>Luscious locks of hair, strong, healthy nails, and luminous skin. What more could you want in a vitamin? Bring out your body’s natural beauty. </p>
	<br><br>

	<li><h3>Calcium ( from lithothamnion red algae) (plant source)</h3>
	<p>Yes, this mineral is one we are all familiar with. Calcium is famous for helping the body create strong teeth and bones. Fun fact, your teeth and bones hold 99% of your body’s calcium – so you definitely want to prevent deficiency of such a critical substance. Bright smiles and strong bones for everyone!  </p>
	<br><br>

	<li><h3>Magnesium (from lithothamnion red algae) (plant source)</h3>
	<p>This stud muffin of a mineral is crucial to the body’s proper functionality. Magnesium can help lower high blood pressure or just help keep it normal, it can assist in regulating heart rhythm, and it helps your body in maintaining strong bones (a friend of Calcium).</p>
	<br><br>

	<li><h3>Zinc (as zinc picolinate)</h3>
	<p>This essential trace element is only needed in very small amounts, but has huge impacts on the body. Zinc can effect all parts of the body of all ages. Prevention of stunted growth and slow wound healing in children? Boosting the immune system and treating the common cold? Zinc is on it!  This jack-of-all-trades has even been used in some cases of cataracts, asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, psoriasis, acne, erectile dysfunction, and weak bones.</p>
	<br><br>

	<li><h3>Selenium (as selenium AAC)</h3>
	<p>Your cells just called. They said they want you to protect them from damage. Don’t worry, 24 Hour Health has you covered. Selenium has major antioxidant properties which some studies show may even reduce the odds of prostate cancer.</p>
	<br><br>

	<li><h3>Chromium (as chromium polynicotinate)</h3>
	<p>Blood sugar (glucose) metabolism, muscle building, and fat burning – all things associated with Chromium activity, one of our favorite mineral ingredients. In a nutshell, Chromium helps to take blood sugar from the blood directly into the cells, where it can be used as energy. It’s like Uber for glucose. </p>  
	<br><br>

	<li><h3>Manganese (as manganese glycinate chelate)</h3>
	<p>This essential nutrient is involved with many processes in the body like the processing of cholesterol, protein, and carbohydrates. Your body actually requires it to function properly, and some people literally use manganese as a medicine. Manganese me up!</p>
	<br><br>
	 
	<li><h3>Omega 3,6 & 9 Fatty Acid Blend</h3>
	<p>One of the most epic components of our formula is the addition of omega-3, omega-6, and omega-9 fatty acids. In case you haven't heard, these fatty powerhouse molecules aid in many crucial functions within the body, such as building healthy cells, maintaining your brilliant brain function, and optimizing nervous system functionality (gotta keep those dance moves flowing). Lots of studies are suggesting this fatty acid blend may help lower the risk of heart disease and protect against other disorders such as type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and age-related cognitive decline. 24 Hour Health - Omega blended for a long healthy life. </p>
	<br><br>


	<li><h3>Prebiotic Multi-Fiber Complex</h3>
	<p>Everyone knows that fiber (or “roughage” as our mom’s call it) is great to keep us regular. Beyond that, fiber can also help keep blood sugar stable, lower cholesterol, and even help you lose fat by keeping your hunger cravings down.</p>
